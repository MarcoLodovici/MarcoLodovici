# 💫 About Me:
I’m a frontend developer specialized in modern web development.

Here you’ll find reusable features, experiments, and tests of new integrations that I like to explore in my projects.

I mainly work with React, Next.js, TypeScript, REST API integrations, web design, and animation libraries.<br><br>
